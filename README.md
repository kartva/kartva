I believe in creating performant, robust and delightful software. I've contributed a bunch to open-source projects. \
**This is a standing invitation: if you want to talk software[^1], [I want to talk to you](mailto:sendtokartavya@gmail.com)[^2].**

### Work / Open-Source Contributions
I previously interned at [Neuralink](https://neuralink.com/) and [Modular](https://www.modular.com/). I previously worked on [icu4x](https://github.com/unicode-org/icu4x), an open-source i18n library by the Unicode consortium, and [Librarian](https://github.com/kartva/Librarian), a bioinformatics quality control tool. <!--- I've contributed feature patches to [Rust Analyzer](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer/), [Rust Clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy/), [Wine](https://gitlab.winehq.org/wine/wine), [OpenSearch](https://github.com/opensearch-project/) and [Zola](https://github.com/getzola/zola/).-->

### Research
I'm broadly interested in programming languages, systems programming and distributed systems. I'm currently interested in making software better through integrating LLMs and formal verification: _Software sucks in so many different ways -- random server errors, stale caches, janky animations -- how can we exploit the ability to generate oodles of code for cents to make it better?_ My previous work was in creating optimizations for [Mergeable Replicated Datatypes](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/suresh/papers/oopsla19-mrdt.pdf) with [Prof. Suresh Jagannathan](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/suresh/).
